Designing your first machine learning pipeline with few lines of codes and simple drag and drop using Orchest. You will learn to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and eventually evaluate the results. In this project we will train binary classification model to predict epitope which is used for vaccine development.

The epitope data obtained from IEDB corresponded to the five types of activity: "Positive-High," "Positive-Intermediate," "Positive-Low," "Positive," and "Negative." However, due to the limited number of data elements marked with the "Positive-High," "Positive-Intermediate," and "Positive-Low" labels, we equally considered these labels as "Positive", thereby attributing the task to a binary estimation.

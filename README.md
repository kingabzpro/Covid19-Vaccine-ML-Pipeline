Designing your first machine learning pipeline with few lines of codes and simple drag & drop using Orchest. You will learn to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and eventually evaluate the results. In this project we will train binary classification model to predict epitope which is used for vaccine development.

We are going to utilize SARS-CoV and B-cell datasets to classify peptides into two categories, antibodies with inducing properties are labeled as positive (1) and antibodies without inducing properties are labeled as negative(0). To learn more about the dataset read the research paper.
